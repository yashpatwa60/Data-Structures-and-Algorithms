I'll be adding few Codes of data structures and algorithm in C here 👇🏻

## Data structures  📌
* Linked list
* Circular linked list
* Double linked list
* Stack 
* Queues
* Binary search Tree
* Heap (max and min heap)
* Adjacency matrix
* Adjacency list

## Sorting Techniques 📌
* Insertion sort
* Selection sort
* Merge sort 
* Quick sort
* Bubble sort
* Topological sort
* External merge sort
* Pancake sort
* Heap Sort
* Counting Sort
* Radix Sort
* Bucket Sort

## Search Techniques  📌
* Linear search
* Binary search
* Breadth first search
* Depth first search

## Algorithms  📌
* Longest common subsequence
* knapsack
* Travelling salesman
* Huffman codes
* Job sequencing
* Prims 
* Kruskal(0-1)
* Dijkstra
* Bellman Ford
